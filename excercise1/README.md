# Problem 1
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just some basic input output control and looping.
 Your output may look different, I don't really care so long as the basic cases are hit.
 The way I wrote this is purposely excessive and confusing, but it should help just a little bit.


##  Description
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The user will enter strings until they type the word quit.
 You will do the following:
* Accept input from the user until they type quit.
* Print the reversed uppercase of each string.
* Count the number of characters in each string
* Print the total number of words (delimited by ' ') typed in each user input
* Print the total number of words typed across all user inputs
* Alert the user if they type exactly 12 words total

## Sample output
```
% ./sample.py
dog
cat
trex
big bois
big big bois
big big big bois
quit
reversed upper of each string:
['GOD', 'TAC', 'XERT', 'SIOB GIB', 'SIOB GIB GIB', 'SIOB GIB GIB GIB']
num chars each string:
[3, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16]
num words each user input:
[1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4]
num words in all user inputs:
total_words_typed:
12
You typed 12 words
```
